# CMSC203 Assignment 5

Minnie and Mickey are getting ready to send out Holiday bonuses to their hard working employees in Retail District #5. The bonuses are calculated based on how much each retail store sold in each category. The retail store with the highest amount sold in a category will receive $5,000. The retail store with the lowest amount sold in a category will receive $1,000. All other retail stores in district #5 will receive $2,000. If a retail store didnâ€™t sale anything in a category, or they have a negative sales amount, they are not eligible for a bonus in that category. If only one retail store sold items in a category, they are eligible to receive only the bonus of $5000 for that category.

## Assignment Description

Create a utility class that manipulates a two-dimensional ragged array of doubles. This utility class will be used to create a Sales Report for Retail District #5. It will accommodate positive and negative numbers. Follow the Javadoc provided. 
Create a utility class that will calculate holiday bonuses given a ragged array of doubles which represent the sales for each store in each category. It will also take in bonus amount for the store with the highest sales in a category, the bonus amount for the store with the lowest sales in a category and the bonus amount for all other stores.

These utility classes will be used with an existing GUI class to create a sales report and display holiday bonuses.
Testing of these utility classes will be done with the JUnit tests and the GUI class provided for you.
